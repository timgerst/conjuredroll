# ConjuredRoll
A small weekend project to solve an issue of too many rolls during combat. The 
main goal is to provide Tabletop RPG particpants a way to roll attacks for 
multiple creatures of the same type, and quickly resolve the outcome. 

## How it works 
This is built mostly on really sketchy regex parsing. I tried to keep it a
simple and clean static page, so just some basic HTML, CSS, and JS, with no
imported libraries or special compilers.
